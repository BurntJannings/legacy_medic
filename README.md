# legacy_medic
Combining of AIMedic and Medical Script for VORP

This script allows the choosing of NPC model, command, price, and multijob restriction for the
spawning of an AI Medic to pick you up, this has been improved upon from the original legacy_aimedic
This also now includes a kickass injury checking system, as a regular player you can check you pulse, your last injury, and the closest persons injury
As a doctor you can check all of these and the patient pulse too!

Planned to come:Checking cause of death and checking cause of wound, plus some pretty UI stuff ;)
